# Incremental_Learning
Implementation of incremental machine learning algorithms for stream learning

--------------------

The repository contains Ipython notebooks for the implmentation of incremental machine learning algorithms, on the iris dataset. 

Currently implemented algorithms are:

* Incremental Neural networks
* Incremental SVM
